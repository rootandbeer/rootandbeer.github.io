This is a fork of the [Reverse Shell Generator](http://www.revshells.org). It has been modified to organize reverse shells by protocol for easier use, along with the addition of more reverse shells.

Use the tool below to generate reverse shells, bind shells, and listener commands for common protocols (e.g. TCP, HTTP, HTTPS). Pick your OS, set LHOST/LPORT, then copy the command or payload you need.
