## Privilege Escalation Methodology

Modern privilege escalation follows a prioritized workflow, starting with quick wins and progressing to more complex techniques:

1. **Quick Checks** - Fast enumeration for common misconfigurations (sudo, SUID, capabilities)
2. **Automated Enumeration** - Run tools like LinPEAS for comprehensive analysis
3. **Manual Enumeration** - Deep dive based on findings (cron, writable files, services)
4. **Advanced Techniques** - Kernel exploits, container escapes (higher risk, last resort)
