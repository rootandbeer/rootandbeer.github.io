Tunneling and pivoting are post-exploitation techniques used after you have access to a host. They let you route traffic through the compromised system to reach internal networks, bypass egress restrictions, or expose local services.

**When to use:** After you have a shell (or other access) on a pivot: choose a method that fits what’s available (e.g. SSH if you have SSH access), set up the tunnel or proxy, then point your tools at the forwarded port or SOCKS proxy.
